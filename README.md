# Sort Visualizer 🎨📊  

## 🚀 Overview  
Sort Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations. The platform provides detailed explanations and implementations of **15+ sorting algorithms** in multiple programming languages, categorized by their **time and space complexity**.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Visualize Sorting Algorithms** – See how different sorting algorithms work step by step.  
✅ **Multi-Language Implementations** – Access code in multiple programming languages.  
✅ **Custom Sorting Algorithm Support** – Design and visualize your own sorting algorithm using the documented APIs.  
✅ **Category-Based Sorting** – Algorithms are grouped based on their efficiency.  

## 📌 Available Sorting Algorithms  
- **Efficient Sorting**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, Shell Sort  
- **Comparison-Based Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Comb Sort, Shaker Sort  
- **Specialized Sorting**: Gnome Sort, Odd-Even Sort, Pancake Sort, Bitonic Sort  
- **Fun & Experimental**: Bogo Sort, Custom Sort
